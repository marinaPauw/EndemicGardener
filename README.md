# EndemicGardener
This webapp is for an indigenous plants nursery. Clients can search for their home from a google maps overlay to find plants that are endemic to their area. These plants are already suited to the climate and will require less water and soil adjuvants. In addition, pollinators in the area will find greater benefit from these plants.
