# EndemicGardener
This webapp is for an indigenous plants nursery. Clients can search for their home from a google maps overlay to find plants that are endemic to their area. These plants are already suited to the climate and will require less water and soil adjuvants. In addition, pollinators in the area will find greater benefit from these plants.

To build this app, the webpack bundle needs to be created externally via commandline:

Navigate to the root directory.
$ npm run build

Now the webpackBundle.js file should be present in the root of the directory. Move this file into the wwwroot/js folder.
