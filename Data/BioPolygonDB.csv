Name;PolygonID;Description
Agulhas Limestone Fynbos;1;"Low hills in plains, fragmented on the coastal margin of the Agulhas coastal forelands. Mainly on the plains, but with significant patches at higher altitudes such as on Soetanysberg. Moderately dense, low shrublands contain tall, emergent proteoids. Structurally it is mainly asteraceous and proteoid fynbos, with restioid fynbos in sandy areas and on limestone pavements. Wetter areas, such as waterlogged bottomlands, are dominated by Leucadendron linifolium restioid fynbos, grading to FFd 7 Agulhas Sand Fynbos where sands become deeper"
Agulhas Sand Fynbos;2;"Low-lying coastal plains supporting dense moderately tall, ericoid shrubland or tall, medium dense shrubland, with some emergent tall shrubs. Communities of this fynbos unit are structurally defined either as restioid or proteoid fynbos."
Albertinia Sand Fynbos;3;"Plains and undulating hills with numerous dune slacks—forming the most extensive area of sand fynbos within the limestone fynbos area and occupying most of the depressions, valleys and lower slopes. Vegetation is characterised by medium tall (1.5–2 m tall) open shrub layer, together with a dense stratum of 1–1.2 m tall shrubs and hemicryptophytes. It is structurally predominantly proteoid fynbos, but with extensive restioid fynbos in the watercourses and coastal edges."
Blombos Strandveld;4;"Flat or slightly undulating coastal landscapes with dense, evergreen, sclerophyllous shrublands and thickets, with a poorly developed undergrowth layer. The thicket vegetation is best developed in dune slacks, where it is well protected from occasional fires that may penetrate the coastal zone from the inland areas and from salt-laden on-shore winds that cause stunting (0.5 m tall, dense vegetation) in exposed littoral situations."
Boland Granite Fynbos;5;"Moderately undulating plains and hills, varying from extensive deep soils, to localised deep soils between large granite domes and sheets. A fairly dense, 1–2 m tall closed shrubland with occasional low, gnarled trees dotted through the landscape. A diverse type, dominated by scrub, asteraceous and proteoid fynbos (with Protea repens, P. burchelli, P. laurifolia with Leucadendron rubrum and L. daphnoides as dominants on drier slopes, Leucospermum grandiflorum or L. gueinzii dominant in seepage areas, and P. neriifolia and Leucadendron sessile on moist slopes), but with patches of restioid and ericaceous fynbos in wetter areas. Waboomveld is very typical and very extensive within this unit."
Canca Limestone Fynbos;6;"A series of hills with parallel crests, sand-filled plains and undulating hills. Neutral and acid sands support FFd 9 Albertinia Sand Fynbos, which dominates the valleys and is far more extensive than in the other limestone fynbos units. This landscape is dominated by the Canca se Leegte and Wankoe depressions, with most of the limestone fynbos on the hill tops and ridges. This vegetation has tall, emergent proteoids in a medium dense low shrubland—mainly asteraceous and proteoid fynbos, with restioid fynbos on skeletal soils. Communities east of the Gouritz River lack the proteoid overstorey and are poorer in species, with Erica particularly rare. Rutaceae are dominant and succulents and geophytes are more abundant, grading into succulent thicket on the coast. Local diversity east of the Gouritz River depends on the extent of limestone patches, with smaller outcrops lacking characteristic species."
Cape Coastal Lagoons;7;Waterbody
Cape Estuarine Salt Marshes;8;"Estuarine flats and systems of low riverine terraces supporting complexes of low herblands and shrublands dominated by succulent chenopods and other flood-tolerant halophytes (especially on supratidal terraces and in middle and lower tidal zones), salt-marsh meadows dominated by rushes and sedges (often indicating freshwater seeps), Spartina swards and (temporary) submerged Zostera sea meadows at the lower boundary of the tidal zone."
Cape Flats Dune Strandveld;9;"Flat to slightly undulating (dune fields) landscape covered by tall, evergreen, hard-leaved shrubland with abundant grasses and annual herbs in gaps."
Cape Flats Sand Fynbos;10;"Moderately undulating and flat plains, with dense, moderately tall, ericoid shrubland containing scattered emergent tall shrubs. Proteoid and restioid fynbos are dominant, with asteraceous and ericaceous fynbos occurring in drier and wetter areas, respectively."
Cape Inland Salt Pans;11;"Small depressions dominated by low succulent scrub composed of creeping cheno­pods and salt-tolerant herbs and grasses. The saline Overberg alluvia are dominated by a low succulent shrub, Sarcocornia mossiana."
Cape Lowland Alluvial Vegetation;12;Flat landscape with slow-flowing (in place meandering) lowland rivers fringed on banks by extensive tall reeds dominated by Phragmites australis and Typha capensis as well as by flooded grasslands and herblands and tall riparian thickets (gallery forests) with Salix mucronata subsp. capensis on the river terraces.
Cape Lowland Freshwater Wetlands;13;"Flats and landscape depressions with extensive tall reeds of Phragmites australis and Typha capensis, temporarily or permanently flooded restiolands, sedgelands and rush-beds as well as macrophytic vegetation embedded in permanent water bodies."
Cape Seashore Vegetation;14;"Beaches, coastal dunes, dune slacks and coastal cliffs of open grassy, herbaceous and to some extent also dwarf-shrubby (sometimes succulent) vegetation, often dominated by a single pioneer species. Various plant communities reflect the age of the substrate and natural disturbance regime (moving dunes), distance from the upper tidal mark and the exposure of dune slopes (leeward versus seaward)."
Cape Winelands Shale Fynbos;15;Moderately undulating plains and steep slopes against the mountains. Vegetation is a moderately tall and dense shrubland dominated by proteoid and closed-scrub fynbos in structural terms.
Central Coastal Shale Band Vegetation;16;"A narrow 80–200 m linear feature (wider in places), smooth and flat in profile compared to surrounding areas. Vegetation comprises various fynbos shrublands."
Central Ruens Shale Renosterveld;17;"Moderately undulating plains and pans. Vegetation is open to medium dense cupressoid and small-leaved, low to moderately tall grassy shrubland, usually dominated by renosterbos. It is distinguished from the Eastern Ruens Shale Renosterveld by the absence of Aloe ferox. Shrubby Asteraceae increase as grazing reduces the palatable grassy component (mostly Hyparrhenia hirta) and subsequent erosion results. Heuweltjies not conspicuous, except in the south of the area. South of Bredasdorp this type is restricted and replaced by FFf 1 Elim Ferricrete Fynbos in wetter areas."
De Hoop Limestone Fynbos;18;"An inland range of hills, with plains and moderately undulating plains on the seaward foreland, in places dotted with karstic sinkholes and dry valleys (poljes). Some of the depressions can be longer than 2 km. Structurally it is mainly asteraceous and proteoid fynbos, with restioid fynbos in sandy areas. These areas were converted to grazing lawns in formerly disturbed (ploughed) areas currently with high game concentrations. Neutral to acid sands support FFd 7 Agulhas Sand Fynbos and FFd 9 Albertinia Sand Fynbos. Extensive skeletal calcrete over shale on the inland border may once also have held limestone fynbos or renosterveld ecotone communities, but these have all been converted to pasture and wheatland, and their vegetation was not documented before their conversion."
Eastern Ruens Shale Renosterveld;19;"Moderately undulating hills and plains supporting cupressoid and small-leaved, low to moderately tall grassy shrubland, dominated by renosterbos. The southern limits are often covered by a thin layer of calcrete. Little of this vegetation remains, but some thicker calcrete deposits, too thick to be ploughed, support mesotrophic asteraceous ‘fynbos’ with Crassula expansa, Leucadendron linifolium and Nylandtia spinosa. It is not known whether the thinner deposits supported renosterveld or intermediate communities. In some places, especially closer to the mountains (Langeberg), Themeda triandra grasslands are found (see Raitt 2005)."
Elgin Shale Fynbos;20;"Undulating hills and moderately undulating plains and steep slopes of adjacent mountains. An open to medium dense tall proteoid shrubland over a matrix of moderately tall and dense evergreen shrubs, dominated by proteoid, asteraceous and closed-scrub fynbos, and ericaceous fynbos in the wetter facies."
Elim Ferricrete Fynbos;21;"Undulating hills and plains covered with open to closed dwarf shrubland with occasional scattered tall shrubs. It is a diverse unit, with all structural fynbos types present, but with extensive areas of asteraceous fynbos dominated by low proteoid elements. To differentiate meso­trophic asteraceous from mesotrophic proteoid fynbos the following proteoid types are recognised: Leucadendron elimense, L. laxum, L. modestum, L. stelligerum and L. teretifolium. When degraded, this vegetation type becomes dominated by Elytropappus rhinocerotis. On transitions to deep sandy soils, Protea repens may be dominant, and these transitional communities are often much richer in species than associated FFs 12 Overberg Sandstone Fynbos."

Greyton Shale Fynbos;23;"Moderately undulating plains and steep slopes of adjacent mountains. The vegetation is a moderately tall and dense shrubland, predominantly proteoid and asteraceous fynbos, with some graminoid fynbos."
Groot Brak Dune Strandveld;24;"Flats, undulating landscapes (stabilised dunes) and steep coastal slopes, covered by dense and tall (up to 3 m), spiny, sclerophyllous scrub with gaps supporting shrublands with ericoids or succulent-leaved shrubs. The graminoid layer is sparse and short."
Hangklip Sand Fynbos;25;"Sand dunes and sandy bottomlands supporting moderately tall, dense ericoid shrubland. Emergent, tall shrubs in places. Proteoid, ericaceous and restioid fynbos are dominant, with some asteraceous fynbos also present. On the coastal fringe this unit borders on strandveld. The deep soils of the coastal plains are replaced by shallow soils on mountain slopes on the northern edge. Hangklip Sand Fynbos occurs mainly on old dunes, but the high rainfall and leaching allows many typical sandstone fynbos species to occur on older deposits as well, so that this unit is not as floristically distinct as other sandstone fynbos units. "
Kogelberg Sandstone Fynbos;26;"High mountains with steep to gentle slopes, and undulating plains and hills of varied aspect. General appearance of vegetation low, closed shrubland with scattered emergent tall shrubs. Proteoid, ericaceous and restioid fynbos dominate, while asteraceous fynbos is rare. Patches of Cape thicket are common in the northern areas; in the south similar habitats are occupied by scrub fynbos. Numerous seeps and seasonally saturated mountain-plateau wetlands (locally called ‘suurvlakte’) are very common and support restioid and ericaceous (dominated by Bruniaceae) fynbos."
Lourensford Alluvium Fynbos;27;"Low-lying plains supporting low, medium dense shrubland with short graminoid understorey. Restioid and asteraceous fynbos are dominant, although there is some evidence that proteoid fynbos might once have been dominant. Some remnants are exceptionally rich in geophytes."
Mossel Bay Shale Renosterveld;28;"Undulating hills and tablelands, steeply dissected by rivers. The vegetation of the area is mainly a medium dense, medium tall cupressoid-leaved shrubland dominated by renosterbos, dotted by sparse, tall shrubs. Thicket patches and thicket elements are common, possibly because the landscape is more rugged than in the case of the Rûens shale renosterveld types, and therefore less prone to fire. Fire-safe habitats, such as steep slopes, gullies and termitaria have thicket clumps, dominated by Euclea undulata, Putterlickia pyracantha and Rhus lucida. Steep north-facing slopes have succulent thicket elements. The southern reaches may be covered with a calcrete layer bearing South Coast limestone fynbos elements."
North Langeberg Sandstone Fynbos;29;"Gentle to steep, north-facing slopes, not much dissected over much of the range. Surface is gently sloping foothills of Waboomsberg, Warmwaterberg and Aasvoëlberg. The Cedarberg Shale Band is prominent in the west, mainly as a smooth-sided valley, along which most of the hiking trails are orientated. Vegetation is mainly proteoid and restioid fynbos, with ericaceous fynbos at higher altitudes and asteraceous fynbos on the lower slopes. Old African surface conglomerates (mapped as part of this unit) on the lower slopes have asteraceous fynbos dominated by Dodonaea viscosa var. angustifolia. Ravines support Cape thicket, dominated by Buddleja saligna, and species of Pelargonium, Rhus and Salvia."
North Sonderend Sandstone Fynbos;30;"Gentle to steep, north-facing slopes, not much dissected over much of the range. Surface is gently sloping foothills of Waboomsberg, Warmwaterberg and Aasvoëlberg. The Cedarberg Shale Band is prominent in the west, mainly as a smooth-sided valley, along which most of the hiking trails are orientated. Vegetation is mainly proteoid and restioid fynbos, with ericaceous fynbos at higher altitudes and asteraceous fynbos on the lower slopes. Old African surface conglomerates (mapped as part of this unit) on the lower slopes have asteraceous fynbos dominated by Dodonaea viscosa var. angustifolia. Ravines support Cape thicket, dominated by Buddleja saligna, and species of Pelargonium, Rhus and Salvia."
Overberg Dune Strandveld;31;"Flat or slightly undulating dune fields of Die Plaat near Stanford and those of De Hoop, supporting up to 4 m tall, closed, evergreen, hard-leaved shrublands in moist dune slacks and wind-protected valleys and up to 1 m tall, coastal thicket in many places wind-shorn along exposed littoral situations."
Overberg Sandstone Fynbos;32;"Low mountains, undulating hills and moderately undulating plains supporting moderately tall, dense restioid, ericoid-leaved and proteoid shrublands. Structurally these are mainly proteoid and ericaceous fynbos, with restioid fynbos also occurring locally."
Peninsula Granite Fynbos;33;"Steep to gentle slopes below the sandstone mountain slopes, and undulating hills on the western edge of the Cape Flats. Medium dense to open trees in tall, dense proteoid shrubland. A diverse type, dominated by asteraceous and proteoid fynbos, but with patches of Restio and ericaceous fynbos in wetter areas. Waboomveld is extensive in the north and heavily encroached by afrotemperate forest in places. South of Hout Bay, the dwarf form of Protea nitida is dominant, so that there are no emergent proteoids. Groves of Silver Trees (Leucadendron argenteum) occur on the wetter slopes."
Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos;34;"Gentle to steep slopes, with cliffs in the north, over a 50 km long peninsula. Vegetation is a medium dense, tall proteoid shrubland over a dense moderately tall, ericoid-leaved shrubland—mainly proteoid, ericaceous and restioid fynbos, with some asteraceous fynbos."
Potberg Ferricrete Fynbos;35;"Slight slopes and moderately undulating plains perched on the northern slopes below Potberg. A medium tall evergreen shrubland. Asteraceous and proteoid fynbos are dominant, with localised stands of restioid fynbos"
Potberg Sandstone Fynbos;36;"Prolonged, moderately steep sandstone coastal inselberg supporting moderately tall, dense restioid, ericoid-leaved and mainly proteoid shrublands. Proteoid and restioid fynbos predominate, other structural types are rare. Deeper kloofs support broad-leaved Cape thicket."
Reclaimed land;37;Reclaimed land
Ruens Silcrete Renosterveld;38;"Highly fragmented patches on the summits and highlands of undulating hills and plains, larger patches often associated with drainage systems. In contrast to the isolated and rare occurrence of silcrete renosterveld on the West Coast, on the South Coast this is a major landscape feature on the uplands, where it forms a remnant African surface. These isolated habitats support open, low, cupressoid and small-leaved, low to moderately tall shrubland characterised by many succulents and usually dominated by renosterbos."
South Sonderend Sandstone Fynbos;39;"Steep to gentle southern slopes, with extensive cliffs in places. Vegetation a moderately tall, dense ericoid-leaved shrubland with open emergent proteoids. Ericaceous and restioid fynbos most common, with proteoid fynbos found mainly on lower slopes."
Southern Afrotemperate Forest;40;"Tall, multilayered afrotemperate forests dominated by yellowwoods (Afrocarpus falcatus and Podocarpus latifolius), Ocotea bullata, Olea capensis subsp. macrocarpa, Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus, Platylophus trifoliatus etc. In scree and deep-gorge habitats Cunonia capensis, Heeria argentea, Metrosideros angustifolia, Podocarpus elongatus and Rapanea melanophloeos predominate. The shrub understorey and herb layers are well developed, especially in mesic and wet  habitats."
Southern Cape Dune Fynbos;41;"Coastal dune cordons (those towering above the Groenvlei near Sedgefield considered the tallest vegetated dunes in southern Africa) often with steep slopes. The vegetation is fynbos heath dominated by sclerophyllous shrubs with a rich restio undergrowth. The dominant shrubs include Olea exasperata and Phylica litoralis, while among restios Ischyrolepis eleocharis is most prominent. The relatively recent (last 100 years) exclusion of fire from a large percentage of this unit enabled many woody species to displace the fynbos vegetation. The alien Acacia cyclops often acted as a precursor for the establishment of thicket vegetation in sites where fynbos or coastal dunes used to occur. These thicket clumps occurring within this dune fynbos are not rich in species and have Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus, Rhus lucida, Sideroxylon inerme and Tarchonanthus littoralis as the dominant species."
Southern Cape Valley Thicket;42;"Steep slopes of deeply incised valleys of rivers flowing mainly in a north-south direction and dissecting the Southern Cape coastal peneplain. Medium-sized to tall (3–5 m), dense thicket composed of sclerophyllous (often spinescent) evergreen shrubs (e.g. Euclea, Grewia, Gymnosporia, Putterlickia, Rhus, Sideroxylon, Tarchonanthus) as well as an important admixture of a microphyllous (partly ericoid) shrub element (Athanasia, Elytropappus, Oedera, Stoebe) and with a prominent (locally also dominant) succulent, rosulate tree, Aloe ferox. The low shrub layer contains a high proportion of succulent shrubs (Aloe, Crassula, Euphorbia, Ruschia). Grasses are abundant in some favoured grazing areas."
Southern Coastal Forest;43;"Generally low forests dominated by Celtis africana, Sideroxylon inerme, Mimusops caffra and Dovyalis rotundifolia. In the eastern regions of the distribution area, having well-developed low-tree and shrub (Brachylaena discolor, Strychnos decussata, Euclea natalensis, Dracaena aletriformis etc.) as well as herb (Isoglossa woodii, Hypoestes aristata, Laportea grossa, Oxalis pes-caprae) layers, becoming increasingly ?oristically and structurally impoverished in a westward direction."
Swartland Shale Renosterveld;44;"Moderately undulating plains and valleys supporting low to moderately tall leptophyllous shrubland of varying canopy cover as well as low, open shrubland dominated by renosterbos. Heuweltjies are a very prominent local feature of the environment, forming ‘hummockveld’ near Piketberg and giving the Tygerberg Hills their name. Stunted trees and thicket are often associated with the heuweltjies. Disturbed areas are dominated by Athanasia trifurcata and Otholobium hirtum. Patches of Cynodon dactylon ‘grazing lawns’ also occur in abundance."
Swartland Silcrete Renosterveld;45;"Moderately undulating lowlands, often on elevated areas. An open, low, cupressoid- and small-leaved, low to moderately tall shrubland with many succulents, dominated by renosterbos."
Swellendam Silcrete Fynbos;46;"Mainly undulating hills on the coastal forelands, the remains of the old African surface. Structurally it is a medium tall evergreen shrubland or grassland. Predominantly asteraceous fynbos, but graminoid fynbos on summits and northern slopes where disturbed. Proteoid fynbos occurs on southern slopes and ericaceous fynbos is found in wetter habitats. Afrotemperate forest occurs in fire-safe alluvial areas, such as along perennial rivers. It is uncertain whether proteoid fynbos, renosterveld or thicket was the dominant type in some of the eastern plateaus—it has all been converted to pasture."
Western Coastal Shale Band Vegetation;47;A narrow 80–200 m linear feature (up to
Western Ruens Shale Renosterveld;48;"Moderately undulating plains, today mostly stripped of natural vegetation and where preserved, supporting an open to medium dense, cupressoid and small-leaved, low to moderately tall grassy shrubland dominated by renosterbos. Heuweltjies are not conspicuous. This unit is distinguished from other Ruens renosterveld types by the absence of Hermannia flammea and rare occurrence of Aloe ferox and Acacia karroo complex. Shrubby Asteraceae increase as grazing reduces the palatable grass component (mostly Hyparrhenia hirta), resulting in subsequent erosion. "
